# kfs

This is our repository for 42's `kfs` (kernel from scratch) project. The aim is to build
a fully functional 32-bit kernel.

## Running the Kernel

`qemu` and `grub-mkrescue` are very specific about their mutual versions, so we made a [DevContainer](.devcontainer) to make it work on every Linux machine.

### Clone kfs

```sh
git clone git@github.com:kentucky-fried-kernel/kfs.git && cd kfs
```

#### Shell

If you don't use `VSCode`, refer to [our devcontainers documentation](./docs/DEVCONTAINER.md).

#### VSCode

If you are in `VSCode` (üó£Ô∏èüí¶), you can just install the [Dev Container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension. Once installed, `VSCode` will prompt you to "Rebuild and Reopen in Container". The first time will take a while, as a whole Docker Image has to be built.

_Note: If you do not get the Dev Container prompt, you can also open the `VSCode` settings (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P) and search for 'Dev Container: Rebuild and Reopen in Container'._

---

**If you have a window manager** you can now run `make run`, which will run the kernel in a `qemu` window.

**If you have a headless system** you can now run `make debug`, which will run the kernel in your shell.
